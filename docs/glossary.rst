    ISO 8601
      `ISO 8601`_ is an international standard for representing dates and times in a consistent format. It specifies that dates should be written as YYYY-MM-DD and times as HH:MM:SS, with optional extensions for time zone and fractions of seconds. ISO 8601 is widely adopted in computing, communication, and documentation for uniformity and ease of parsing across systems.

    Planck Time
      `Planck Time`_ Unit is the smallest measurable unit of time, based on fundamental physical constants. It represents the time it takes for light to travel a distance equal to the `Planck length`_. It is approximately XXX seconds. In the UTMS framework, Planck time is used as a universal measure of time that is consistent across all frames of reference, regardless of relativistic effects.

    Big Bang
      The `Big Bang`_ refers to the cosmic event that marked the beginning of the universe around 13.8 billion years ago. It is characterized by the rapid expansion of space from a `singularity`_, which led to the formation of matter, energy, and time itself. The Big Bang is considered the origin of the observable universe and the starting point for many cosmological models of time.

    Logarithmic Scale
      A `Logarithmic Scale`_ is a nonlinear scale used to represent quantities that span several orders of magnitude. In such a scale, each unit increase represents a multiplication of the previous value rather than a fixed addition. This is useful for displaying values that vary widely in scale, such as measuring time across cosmic and quantum realms, where small and large intervals must be represented compactly.
