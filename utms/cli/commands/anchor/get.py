"""Module for registering the "anchor get" command.

This module provides functionality to register the "anchor get" command, which allows users
to retrieve and print the properties of a specific anchor identified by its label. The command
is registered using the `CommandManager` class from the core commands module.

Imports:
    - `Command`: Class used to define a command.
    - `CommandManager`: Class responsible for managing commands in the CLI.

Exports:
    - `register_anchor_get_command`: Function to register the "anchor get" command.

Usage:
    Import this module and use the `register_anchor_get_command` function to add the
    "anchor get" command to your `CommandManager` instance:
        from module_name import register_anchor_get_command

        register_anchor_get_command(command_manager)

    """Parses a comma-separated string and returns a sorted list of `Anchor`
    objects.

    This method splits the input string by commas, retrieves `Anchor` objects associated
    with each item, and adds them to a list. It also includes additional anchors based on
    groups associated with each item. The resulting list is sorted by the `value` attribute
    of the `Anchor` objects.

    Args:
        input_text (str): A comma-separated string of items, each representing
                           an anchor or group identifier.

    Returns:
        List[Anchor]: A sorted list of `Anchor` objects.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any of the items in the input string cannot be resolved to
                    an `Anchor` object.

    Notes:
        - The method first retrieves anchors using the `get()` method, and then
          appends anchors retrieved by group using `get_anchors_by_group()`.
        - The sorting is done based on the `value` attribute of the `Anchor` objects.

        command_manager (CommandManager): The command manager responsible for
            registering and managing commands.

    Command Details:
