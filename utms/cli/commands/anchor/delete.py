"""Module for handling anchor deletion commands within the `utms` command-line
interface.

This module provides the functionality to delete anchors by label,
ensuring that dynamic anchors (which change on each run) cannot be
deleted.

Functions:
    delete_anchor(args: argparse.Namespace, config: Config) -> None:
        Deletes an anchor based on the provided command-line arguments
        and saves the updated configuration.

    register_anchor_delete_command(command_manager: CommandManager) -> None:
        Registers the "anchor delete" command and its associated
        arguments with the command manager.
